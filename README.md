# Entegrate

This is meant to help with the immigration process from South Africa to the 
Netherlands. Going through this process can be extremely stressful, and because 
there are so many processes that needs to fall in place, it tends to make you 
feel like you don't know what is going on anymore, and where you are in the 
process.

This application is meant to help you keep track of the process, and to help 
identify which tasks should be done, and how they can be done - are they dependent 
on previous tasks, or can they be done in parallel?

It is also meant to help keep track of how far you are in your process, because 
this can also be quite daunting, not having a clear timeline of when you can
expect to be done with the process.
